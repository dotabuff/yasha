# Yasha

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dotabuff/yasha.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dotabuff/yasha)

Dota 2 (Source 1) replay parser written in Go, extracted from [Dotabuff TrueSight](https://secure.dotabuff.com/truesight).

We're working on both maintaining the parser for replays of both Source 1 and Source 2 Engines.

## About Source 1

This parser is able to parse replays recorded since about 2012.

## About Source 2

The upcoming Source 2 Engine requires several incompatible changes, so we work on it in a separate repository.

## Installation

Simple as:

    $ go get github.com/dotabuff/yasha

And in your code:

    import "github.com/dotabuff/yasha"

Please be aware that you _can't import_ Sange and Yasha in the same binary!
The Protocol Buffer definitions conflict, and will panic.

## Test Coverage

Yasha is a dependency of and was extracted from [Dotabuff TrueSight](https://secure.dotabuff.com/truesight). Test coverage is currently upstream. We'll be working to implement comprehensive testing in both Yasha and Sange and are especially grateful for contributions in this area.
